We will let the metrics tell us who the winner is.\n",

Thus, instead of clumping all 3 ideas into one test (and thus not learning the driving force in the win), we will run 3 separate tests, use the previous winners as the baseline in the next test. It's natural to test chunking first, then fine-tuning the embedding model, then retrieval ranking since that's the natural flow of RAG.\n",

            "Exception raised in Job[149]: OutputParserException(Invalid json output: Variance reduction techniques, such as CUPED, improve the sensitivity of online experiments by leveraging pre-experiment data as covariates. CUPED uses a variable collected during a pre-experiment period, denoted as \\(X_i \\equiv Y^{pre}_i\\), which is strongly correlated with the outcome variable \\(Y_i\\) measured during the experiment. Incorporating this pre-experiment data allows CUPED to effectively reduce the variance of the treatment effect estimator. This variance reduction is especially valuable when treatment effects are small and sample sizes are limited because it enables more precise assessment of the treatment impact. Lower variance allows statistical significance to be achieved faster or with fewer users. This capability enables experiments to run on smaller populations or shorter durations, improving the feedback cycle and agility in launching or stopping features. CUPED does not rely on parametric assumptions or linear models, making it broadly applicable to various metrics. The technique requires that prior information, such as pre-experiment data, exists for the users included in the experiment. Studies have shown that CUPED can reduce variance substantially, by approximately 45% to 52% in Bing’s online experimentation system. Reducing variance increases the sensitivity and efficiency of controlled experiments. Using pre-experiment data as covariates correlated with the outcome enhances the power of online experiments. This enhancement is especially significant when sample sizes are limited or treatment effects are small.\n",

            "Exception raised in Job[266]: OutputParserException(Invalid json output: The Harvard Business School emphasizes the importance of controlled online experiments in navigating the online business environment. Microsoft Bing's experience exemplifies the use of controlled online experiments. Rigorous experimentation transforms decision-making into a scientific, evidence-driven process. Relying solely on intuition or conflicting opinions is less effective than rigorous experimentation. Small changes, such as color tweaks or ad size adjustments, can lead to significant improvements in user experience and revenue. Bing's color adjustments improved task success and monetization by over 10 million dollars annually. Resizing ads increased revenue by more than 50 million dollars annually without harming user satisfaction. Bing's ability to run over 10,000 experiments annually was supported by Microsoft’s experimentation system (ExP). Microsoft’s experimentation system lowered the overhead of running experiments and facilitated scientific evaluation. The greatest learning from experiments occurs when actual results differ from expected outcomes. If an experiment confirms expectations, little is learned from it. Contradictory results from experiments provide important insights. Bing’s approach of running many experiments regularly allowed it to identify numerous revenue-related and user satisfaction improvements. Bing’s systematic testing contributed to its profitability and market share growth. Many organizations, including major digital enterprises, often have a haphazard approach to experimentation. A haphazard approach to experimentation limits an organization’s ability to benefit fully from it. Systematic, well-designed controlled experiments are essential for making informed decisions in the online world. Controlled experiments drive innovation and achieve significant business impact in online environments.\n",

            "Exception raised in Job[224]: OutputParserException(Invalid json output: Sections 6.1.2 and 2.1 provide guidance on designing experiments with adequate power and applying variance reduction techniques like CUPED. Section 2.1 emphasizes analyzing experiments with sufficient statistical power and sample size. It recommends transforming the outcome variable \\(Y\\) into a lower variance version \\(Y^*\\) to improve sensitivity. This section reviews methodologies such as control variates and stratified sampling to reduce variance and improve power. Section 6.1.2 highlights the use of CUPED as a variance reduction technique. CUPED leverages pre-experiment data \\(X_i \\equiv Y^{pre}_i\\) that is correlated with the outcome variable \\(Y_i\\) to reduce variance. Using the same metric from the pre-experiment period typically yields the greatest variance reduction. CUPED does not require linear model assumptions and can be viewed as an efficiency augmentation in semi-parametric estimation. Practical guidance for applying CUPED includes selecting the best length for the pre-experiment period and using multiple covariates. These sections collectively inform best practices by emphasizing the importance of sufficient power and sample size, utilizing variance reduction techniques like CUPED to increase sensitivity, selecting appropriate covariates and pre-experiment periods to maximize variance reduction, and recognizing that variance reduction methods improve experiment efficiency, potentially doubling traffic or halving the time to reach statistical significance.\n",

            "Exception raised in Job[145]: OutputParserException(Invalid json output: Variance reduction techniques such as CUPED (Controlled experiments Utilizing Pre-Experiment Data) enhance the sensitivity of online experiments. CUPED leverages pre-experiment data that has a strong correlation with the response variable. CUPED uses a covariate, denoted as \\( Y_i \\), which is collected during a pre-experiment period. The covariate \\( X_i \\) is equivalent to the pre-experiment response variable \\( Y_{pre_i} \\). This approach allows for nonlinear adjustments to the response variable. Nonlinear adjustments can significantly increase the sensitivity of the experiment. Increased sensitivity reduces the time required to achieve statistical significance when evaluating treatment effects. Incorporating pre-experiment data reduces the variance in the estimated treatment effect. Reducing variance makes it easier to detect small treatment effects. This is especially beneficial when sample sizes are limited. Higher sensitivity enables experiments to be conducted on smaller populations. Higher sensitivity also allows for shorter experiment durations. Shorter durations and smaller populations improve experimental agility. Improved agility facilitates the execution of more non-overlapping experiments. Research indicates that combining CUPED with other variance reduction methods can further improve performance. Examples of other methods include variance-weighted estimators and synthetic controls. Combining methods can enhance performance beyond what each method achieves individually. Care must be taken when covariates do not meet certain requirements, such as pre-triggering conditions. Failure to meet these requirements can lead to incorrect adjustments. In summary, variance reduction methods like CUPED utilize pre-experiment data as covariates. Using pre-experiment data reduces variance in treatment effect estimates. This reduction improves the sensitivity and efficiency of online controlled experiments. The benefits are especially notable when treatment effects are small and sample sizes are limited.\n",

That being said, we don't want to make assumptions. Later in the notebook, we investigate its latency using LangSmith. If we find it to cause a decent amount of latency, we will definitely reconsider our choice as we always want to consider latency in app-building decisions. \n",

So we tried to do this in the most apples to apples way possible. The fine-tuned embedding model using chat model to generate questions probably would have done much better if it was able to train on more than 240 out of ~9,000 chunks. But that would have been very costly in terms of time (and money!). Thus, the argument can be made that given roughly the same compute resources, the knowledge graph version performed much better (recall that the knowledge graph version never saw our ~9,000 chunks. Instead, Ragas's knowledge graph used the actual loaded PDF files themselves (it makes its own chunks)). That being said, again, with such small sample size, we can't be too confident in our results (we should test this again with a much larger sample size)!\n",

While\\nwidely used in practice, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the\\nstate-of-the-art in A/B testing. This paper reports the results of a systematic\\nliterature review that analyzed 141 primary studies. The results shows that the\\nmain targets of A/B testing are algorithms and visual elements. Single classic\\nA/B tests are the dominating type of tests. Stakeholders have three main roles\\nin the design of A/B tests: concept designer, experiment architect, and setup\\ntechnician. The primary types of data collected during the execution of A/B\\ntests are product/system data and user-centric data. The dominating use of the\\ntest results are feature selection, feature rollout, and continued feature\\ndevelopment. Stakeholders have two main roles during A/B test execution:\\nexperiment coordinator and experiment assessor. The main reported open problems\\nare enhancement of proposed approaches and their usability. Interesting lines\\nfor future research include: strengthen the adoption of statistical methods in\\nA/B testing, improving the process of A/B testing, and enhancing the automation\\nof A/B testing.\\n\\nPublished: 2019-02-08\\nTitle: Systematization of Vulnerability Discovery Knowledge: Review Protocol\\nAuthors: Nuthan Munaiah, Andrew Meneely\\nSummary: In this report, we describe the review protocol that will guide the\\nsystematic review of the literature in metrics-based discovery of\\nvulnerabilities.

While\\nwidely used in practice, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the\\nstate-of-the-art in A/B testing. This paper reports the results of a systematic\\nliterature review that analyzed 141 primary studies. The results shows that the\\nmain targets of A/B testing are algorithms and visual elements. Single classic\\nA/B tests are the dominating type of tests. Stakeholders have three main roles\\nin the design of A/B tests: concept designer, experiment architect, and setup\\ntechnician. The primary types of data collected during the execution of A/B\\ntests are product/system data and user-centric data. The dominating use of the\\ntest results are feature selection, feature rollout, and continued feature\\ndevelopment. Stakeholders have two main roles during A/B test execution:\\nexperiment coordinator and experiment assessor. The main reported open problems\\nare enhancement of proposed approaches and their usability.
